# 🍽️ PRODGIGY_ML_05 - Food Recognition with Calorie Estimation

This project builds a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify food images from the **Food-101 dataset** and estimate their calorie content.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Food-101](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101)
- Contains 101 food classes with 1,000 images each.

---

## 🧠 Model Summary

- Built using TensorFlow/Keras
- Trained on 128x128 resized images
- CNN layers: Conv2D → MaxPool → Flatten → Dense
- Simple calorie mapping for each predicted label

---

## 📊 Accuracy Graph

> Accuracy and loss over 10 epochs plotted using Matplotlib.

## 🔢 Sample Calorie Estimation Mapping

| Food Item   | Estimated Calories |
|-------------|--------------------|
| apple_pie   | 300 kcal           |
| pizza       | 285 kcal           |
| sushi       | 200 kcal           |
| ice_cream   | 210 kcal           |
